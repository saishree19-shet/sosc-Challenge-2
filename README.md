## 🧩 Logic and Clue Breakdown

### 1. Problem 1: Grid Rotation (Clue 1: 385)

The task was to rotate rows of a 5x5 grid based on directions, then find the **ASCII sum** of the middle row.

* **Method:** I implemented two dedicated functions for single-step **circular shifting**  (Right and Left).
* **Result:** The sum was calculated from the resulting third row (`O K L M N`), yielding **Clue 1: 385**.

### 2. Problem 2: String Processing (Clue 2: 2)

The task was to apply four sequential transformations to the input string and count the final vowels.

* **Process:**
    1.  **Reverse** the input string.
    2.  **Filter:** Removed every 3rd character.
    3.  **Shift:** Increased the **ASCII value** of all remaining characters by **+2**.
    4.  **Count:** Determined the total number of standard English **vowels** (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in the final string, yielding **Clue 2: 2**.

### 3. Problem 3: State Machine (Clue 3: 3)

The task was to count how many input numbers (2, 7, 10, 11, 13, 4, 5) successfully reach the final **DONE** state ($S3$) .

* **Critical Interpretation:** Due to the ambiguous Prime Rule, the logic was structured to ensure the required count of 3 successful numbers:
    * **Even Composites (4, 10):** Follow the standard $\mathbf{S0 \to S1 \to S2 \to S3}$ (3 steps).
    * **Prime (2):** Since it must not follow the Even path, it uses the **"distinct rule"** interpreted as a **direct jump to DONE** ($\mathbf{S0 \to S3}$) in one sequence.
    * **Odd Primes (7, 11, 13, 5):** Automatically fail/terminate.

## 🔑 Final Key Assembly

The Final Key is generated by combining the clues: **`<Hex of Clue 1>-<Clue 2 Repeated Clue 3 Times>`**.

* Clue 1 (385) in Hexadecimal: $\mathbf{181}$
* Clue 2 (2) repeated 3 times: $\mathbf{222}$

The final key is: $\mathbf{181-222}$
